# Search Engine

Web-based search engine

Technologies :    Java, Spring MVC, jSoup, jQuery

Simplified search engine using efficient sorting algorithms and data structures for creating a list of all the unique words that appear in any document, and for each word, a list of the documents in which it appears (inverted index). Successfully optimized time and space complexities. 

System Flow:- 
•	Getting html files from a local directory 
•	Converting html files into text using library jsoup 
•	Creating inverted index of all words found in above text files 
•	Suggesting word when typing letter in a search bar using 'Edit distance' formula 
•	Page Ranking according to word frequency 

Technical wrap-up: 
• Implementation in Java language 
• Used Java framework, Spring MVC for server side programming with JSP as view 
• SVN for version control 
• Responsive Front-end: Javascript, jQuery
